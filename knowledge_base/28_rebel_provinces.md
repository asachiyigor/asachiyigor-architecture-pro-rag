# Rebel Provinces

The Rebel Provinces was a coalition of star systems that attempted to secede from the Grand Tsardom, sparking the War of Brothers.

## Formation

**Grievances**:
- Over-taxation of trade routes
- Under-representation in Senate
- Corporate control of government
- Corruption in White Stone City
- Neglect of Outer Rim worlds

**Leadership**:
- Count Dooku (Count Dracula) - former Bogatyr
- Trade Federation leaders
- Corporate Alliance representatives
- Banking Clan financiers

## Member Systems

Thousands of systems including:
- Geonosis (military manufacturing)
- Swan Lake Kingdom (Queen Amidala's world)
- Various Outer Rim colonies
- Corporate-controlled sectors

## Military

**Iron Soldier Army**:
- Iron Soldiers (droids)
- Super Iron Soldiers
- Destroyer Synthetics
- Vulture fighters
- Thousands of warships

**Advantages**:
- No living casualties
- Rapid production
- Fearless in combat
- Coordinated via central control

**Weaknesses**:
- Vulnerable to central control destruction
- Limited initiative
- Predictable tactics

## The Conspiracy

Unknown to most Syndicate members:
- Secretly controlled by Zmey Gorynych
- Entire war was orchestrated
- Leaders manipulated on both sides
- Goal was never actual independence
- Planned to be betrayed once Bogatyrs eliminated

## Collapse

At war's end:
- Iron Soldier armies shut down
- Leadership assassinated
- Member systems forcibly re-integrated
- Assets seized by Dominion
- Became example of "rebellion's futility"

## Legacy

The Breakaway crisis was manufactured, but legitimate grievances that sparked it remained unaddressed, eventually leading to formation of the Alliance of Heroes decades later.
