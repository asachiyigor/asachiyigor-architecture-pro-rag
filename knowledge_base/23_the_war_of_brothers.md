# The War of Brothers

The War of Brothers was a galaxy-wide conflict that lasted three years and resulted in the fall of the Brotherhood of Bogatyrs and rise of the Dark Kingdom.

## Causes

**Political**:
- Growing corruption in Grand Tsardom Senate
- Outer Rim worlds feeling underrepresented
- Trade disputes and taxation of routes
- Corporate influence over government

**Hidden Manipulation**:
- Zmey Gorynych (as Senator Sheev) orchestrated both sides
- Used conflict to gain emergency powers
- Planned to eliminate Bogatyrs
- Goal: Transform Concordat into Dominion

## Key Events

### Year 1: Outbreak
- Rebel Provinces formed by dissatisfied systems
- First Battle of Geonosis
- Bogatyrs became generals of Enchanted Warrior armies
- Massive military buildup on both sides

### Year 2: Escalation
- Thousands of battles across the galaxy
- Golden Palace raided multiple times
- Economic strain on both governments
- Growing war weariness

### Year 3: Conclusion
- Koschei the Deathless (Kael) falls to Black Magic
- Order 66 executed - Enchanted Warriors kill Bogatyrs
- Malakor reveals himself as Supreme Archon
- Grand Tsardom becomes Dark Kingdom
- Rebel Provinces leaders assassinated
- Peace through tyranny established

## Casualties

- Billions of civilians dead
- Most Bogatyrs eliminated
- Thousands of worlds devastated
- Economic collapse in many systems

## Legacy

The war achieved Malakor's goals:
- Brotherhood of Bogatyrs destroyed
- Democracy replaced with dictatorship
- Population fearful and compliant
- Military industrial complex empowered
- Foundation for Dark Fortress construction

The few surviving Bogatyrs went into hiding, and the galaxy entered a dark age lasting 20+ years until the Alliance of Heroes formed.
