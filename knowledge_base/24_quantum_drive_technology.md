# Quantum Drive Technology

Quantum drive allows starships to travel faster than light through magical travel space, making interstellar travel practical.

## Principles

**Quantum Tunneling**: Ships don't move through normal space, but tunnel through an alternate dimension where physics work differently, allowing apparent FTL travel.

**Navigation**: Complex calculations required to avoid:
- Gravity wells (can pull ship out of quantum space)
- Asteroid fields
- Other ships
- Spatial anomalies

## Drive Classes

Rating indicates relative speed:
- Class 0.5: Fastest (modified, very rare)
- Class 1: Military standard
- Class 2: Civilian fast
- Class 3-4: Commercial average
- Class 6+: Slow freighters

Lower number = faster speed

## Components

**Hypermatter Reactor**: Provides enormous energy needed

**Field Generator**: Creates quantum tunnel effect

**Navigation Computer**: Calculates safe routes

**Motivator**: Apprentice Heroes jump

## Safety Features

- Gravity well detection (prevents jumping near planets)
- Collision sensors
- Emergency shutoff
- Backup power systems

## Notable Drives

**Flying Ship's Drive**: Modified Class 0.5, illegally enhanced, can outrun Iron Warships but prone to breaking down

## Limitations

- Can't jump from within gravity wells
- Requires clear route calculation
- Fuel intensive
- Expensive to maintain
- Mass affects speed

## In Combat

Usually can't be used during battle due to:
- Enemy ships preventing calculation time
- Tractor beams
- Interdiction fields
- Need to escape gravity effects
