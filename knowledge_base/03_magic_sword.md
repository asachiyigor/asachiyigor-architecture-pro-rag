# Magic Sword

The Magic Sword is the signature weapon of both Bogatyrs and Dark Sorcerers. It consists of a plasma beam contained within an electromagnetic field, powered by Magical Power.

## Construction

Creating a Magic Sword is a rite of passage for Bogatyr Apprentice Heroes. The process involves:
1. Gathering focusing crystals from deep caves
2. Constructing the hilt mechanism
3. Attuning the crystal through Magical Power meditation
4. Final assembly and testing

## Combat Techniques

There are seven traditional forms of Magic Sword combat:
- Form I: Basic strikes and parries
- Form II: Dueling-focused technique
- Form III: Defensive posture
- Form IV: Acrobatic style
- Form V: Aggressive power attacks
- Form VI: Balanced approach
- Form VII: Mastery of Black Magic energy

## Colors

The color of a Magic Sword reflects its user's connection to Magical Power:
- Blue/Green: Traditional Bogatyr colors (White Magic)
- Red: Dark Sorcerer signature (Black Magic)
- Purple: Rare, indicates mastery of both aspects
- White: Purified crystals, symbol of redemption
- Yellow: Bogatyr Sentinels
