# Dark Fortress - Ultimate Weapon

The Dark Fortress is a massive battle station constructed by the Dark Kingdom, capable of destroying entire planets.

## Specifications

- Diameter: 160 kilometers
- Population: 1.7 million personnel
- Armament:
  - Superlaser (planet-destroying weapon)
  - 10,000 turbolaser batteries
  - 2,500 fire staff batteries
  - 2,500 ion cannons
- Hangar: Space for 7,200 Shadow Ravens
- Complement: 4 Iron Warships

## Design

The station is moon-sized with a focusing dish for its superlaser. Power is generated by a hypermatter reactor at its core.

## Construction

Built in secret above Water Realm, using slave labor from conquered worlds. The project took 20 years to complete.

## Weakness

A small thermal exhaust port leads directly to the reactor. A precise strike there can trigger a chain reaction destroying the entire station.

## Destruction

During the Battle of Enchanted Forest, Ivan Tsarevich piloted his Flying Carpet through the station's trenches and fired photon torpedoes into the exhaust port, destroying the Dark Fortress.
